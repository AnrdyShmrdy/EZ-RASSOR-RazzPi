#This command will create a hotspot:
sudo nmcli d wifi hotspot ifname wlan0 ssid pi4B_hotspot password H0tt3stSp0t autoconnect true
#In order to have hotspot turn on at startup we need to set "autoconnect=true"
#Run the command below and change the line that says "autoconnect=false" to "autoconnect=true"
sudo vim NetworkManager/system-connections/Hotspot.nmconnection 
#Alternatively you can try running this command to do the same thing. Dunno if it works though as I haven't tested it:
nmcli con modify Hotspot connection.autoconnect true
